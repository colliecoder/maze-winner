## For Beginners: 
This repository is beginner friendly! As such we have a different process for contributors that are still building up their confidence:

- Fork this repo
- Look over the repository and find an area you would like to work on
  - a good first project would be to pick an incomplete function to work on within maze_completion.js or maze_solver.js.
  - a good first documentation project would be to pick an algorithm within maze_completion.js or maze_solver.js, do research on it and contribute 2+ paragraphs and a diagram or 3+ paragraphs without a diagram
- Once you have decided what you would like to work on create comments within the code outlining your chosen contribution
  - If you picked a function to work on create comments with basic pseudocode describing how you will solve the problem or if applicable modify existing pseudocode. Below is an example of what pseudocode can look like:
  
   ``` 
  function myFunction(array, findMe) {
    variable answer 
  
     iterate through array for length of array 
        on current position check if equal to findMe
        if equal to findMe
            answer = current position
    return answer
  }
  ```
  - For documentation create a comment in the README.md file with your overall topic and a comment on what each paragraph will focus on
  - For any section in the code you would like to work on create a comment indicating you plan on working on that section. 
- Add your name to contributors in README.md using the format below: 

``` [Name](https://github.com/username) ```

- Submit a pull request
- Your pull request will not be approved yet but we will be able to comment on your pseudocode or documentation outline to give you guidance and will know what you are working on so no one else works on it
- Complete your contribution
- Comment and let us know you have completed your contribution
- and done... will be reviewed soon
